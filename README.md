# Voice-assistant-with-GUI
Python voice assitant with a simple GUI

Hi. I made this voice assistant with the help of Github, stackoverflow, and other websites to make the UI. It's not much, but it's honest work. :)
Latest addition: 10.11.2021: made an application so it can run using the winow from UI only. To see it, clone the repo and then follow this path:
pythonProject\output\user-interface\user-interface.exe

(the user-interface file with application type)
P.S. The code in the output folder is not mine, I only took it so I could make an application, user-interface.exe, to make it easier to run the code without 
having to open the project.
